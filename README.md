Stay productive with the help of adorable kitties.  

This is a short project I've created to start learning ElectronJS. This is a small organization & productivity app where users can set tasks and finish them with the support of adorable kitties.

### It was made with...
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* ElectronJS

## Installation Instructions

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```git clone https://github.com/Btelgeuse/GreenProductive.git```
2. Install NPM packages
```npm install```
3. Install ElectronJS
```npm install --save-dev electron```

## Usage

To run the application, run the command ```npm start```
In this application you can create tasks, by writing it in the text field, then clicking the "+" button. It will appear on the
to-do list displayed below the date and the input field, and you'll be able to click on it once you got it done to strikethrough
the line. It will update automatically your progression bar, that updates its value according to the number of tasks you put, and
the number of tasks you finished.


Once you're done, click on the finish button to get your daily achievement score!
